I am starting my laravel mastery journey with this [basic project](https://github.com/sourav-malo/011-laravel-introductory-ele) building a basic customized portfolio. I purchased that course from [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/laravel-multi-vendor-ecommerce-project/) with a lot of hope. But, I am not super happy since it has got more negatives than positives. Sadly, I intentionally left many bad practices and security vulnerabilities. I will not keep this project updated with best practices. I intend to do 2 laravel courses from YouTube to clear my fundamentals and learn best practices for a beginner at least. To conclude, the site is successfully deployed on a shared hosting. You can check it right [here](https://laravel-portfolio-ele.salahrand.me).
